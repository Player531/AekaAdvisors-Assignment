# AekaAdvisors-Assignment
This is an assignment given by Aeka Advisors to Chirag Barbhaya. The task is to do atleast 2 assignments.
I have selected these two:
```
2) REST Backend Project
4) Data Engineering
```
# 2. REST Backend Project
Develop a Simple REST API for a ToDo App. The application should have the following:
- User Authentication
- Store user information in a database

- Store entries in a Database

## To use todo app using API Endpoint we can use
- [cURL](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/MANUAL.md), a CLI tool to transfer data from a server
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/), A platform used to design, build and test APIs
